# Anime-Recommendation
## Objective  
To develop a machine learning-based model that recommends animes to users based on their preferences and viewing history.  
  
### Types of Filtering  
#### Collaborative Filtering  
Collaborative filtering predicts user preferences by analyzing patterns in user behavior. It assumes that users who have agreed on animes in the past will continue to do so in the future.  
Example:  
User A and User B both liked Movie X and Movie Y. If User A likes Movie Z, User B is likely to enjoy Movie Z as well.  
#### Content-Based Filtering  
Content-based filtering recommends animes by comparing the content of animes that a user has enjoyed in the past with other animes' content. It focuses on the attributes of the animes.  
Example:  
If a user likes sci-fi animes with a strong female lead, the system will recommend other sci-fi animes with similar characteristics.
